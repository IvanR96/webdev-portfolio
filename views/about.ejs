      <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
        <p class="fs-5 mb-5">My name is Ivan Rios. I am currently seeking opportunities in Web Development. I began learning Web Development when I started college. After learning for a while I know that Web Development is very difficult and even when learning for about a year there is always something to learn and new challenges to face along the way.<br>  Iâ€™m always seeking new challenges to enhance my skills and contribute to cutting-edge projects. To enhance my skills, I regularly seek feedback from peers and attend coding meetups, which keeps me updated on the latest trends and best practices. I thrive in environments where I can learn from others, share my knowledge, and continuously improve as a developer. </p>
